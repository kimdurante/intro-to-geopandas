# Introduction to GeoPandas


GeoPandas is an extension of the open-source Python Data Analysis Library, Pandas, which can be used to read, write, and analyze vector geospatial data formats. GeoPandas enables you to easily do operations in Python that would otherwise require a spatial database such as PostGIS. In this workshop, we will introduce GeoPandas and learn how to perform a variety of geospatial data science tasks to work efficiently with geographic vector datasets.
